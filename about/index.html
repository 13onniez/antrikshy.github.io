    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I am a software developer, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I am highly driven as a software engineer, and try to write highly readable, maintainable and efficient code. I want to design delightful experiences that touch the lives of many.

    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I am originally from Mumbai. I moved to San Diego for university in 2012. There, I worked with <a href="https://learningequality.org">Learning Equality</a>, an organization that is bringing the online learning revolution offline, and the minds behind KA Lite - an offline deployment of Khan Academy. I have also did some web development for <a href="http://legday.co">LegDay</a>, a new startup that will connect people at the gym.

    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      Meanwhile, I have worked on numerous personal projects; some small, some big. My portfolio includes an assortment of little scripts, libraries and tinkerings. It also includes <a href="http://quibbler.co">Quibbler.co</a>, an experimental group chat experience that allows anybody to anonymously write messages that are visualized like a word-cloud, only to permanently disappear after a few seconds.

      In the summer of 2015, I worked as a software engineering intern at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. There, I picked up my first experiences working with enterprise scale web applications. I was in charge of a critical part of a massive liquidations related project cooked up by the Warehouse Deals & Liquidations team.
