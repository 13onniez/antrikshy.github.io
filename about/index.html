    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I am a software developer, recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego. I am highly driven as a software engineer, and try to write highly readable, maintainable and efficient code. I want to design delightful experiences that touch the lives of many.

    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I am from Mumbai. After two years in Phnom Penh, I moved to San Diego for university in 2012. There, I worked with <a href="https://learningequality.org">Learning Equality</a>, an organization that is bringing the online learning revolution offline, and the minds behind KA Lite - an offline deployment of Khan Academy. I also did some web development for <a href="http://legday.co">LegDay</a>.

    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      Meanwhile, I have worked on numerous personal projects; some small, some big. My portfolio includes an assortment of little scripts, libraries and tinkerings. It also includes <a href="http://quibbler.co">Quibbler.co</a>, an experimental group chat experience that allows anybody to write messages anonymously. These messages are visualized like a word cloud, and disappear forever in a few seconds.

    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      In the summer of 2015, I worked as a software engineering intern at Amazon's Seattle headquarters. There, I gained my first experiences of working with enterprise scale web application development. I was in charge of a critical part of a new project cooked up by the Warehouse Deals & Liquidations team.
    </p>
    <p class="about-longform text-indent">
      I have travelled around India and south-east Asia quite a bit. Other than programming and design, I am very enthusiastic about video games and movies.
