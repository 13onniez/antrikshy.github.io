Welcome to my personal blog! As I grow my skills, work on projects and experiment with code, I will inevitably come across things that are not well-documented online. I may figure out ways to accomplish something on a path that is not well-trodden. I may design something that requires documentation on a clean page but does not necessitate a GitHub repository. This is what this blog is for. To rephrase, I will document things on this blog that I don't find elsewhere and which people like me might need at some point.

## Examples of posts that may come:

* How to [do something] using [some less-known framework/technology]
* List of useful commands to [do something] in [some programming language]
* Problems I faced while setting up [something]
